**DataScience Project**
Every Data Science Project starts with a question that is to be answered with data. That means that forming the question is an important first step in the process. The second step is finding or generating the data youâ€™re going to use to answer that question. With the question solidified and data in hand, the data are then analyzed, first by exploring the data and then often by modeling the data, which means using some statistical or machine learning techniques to analyze the data and answer your question. After drawing conclusions from this analysis, the project has to be communicated to others.
